### Life comes fast 

Updated: I have officially left Mozilla. I have had mixed feelings about this because the current job market is really tough. Over the past month, I have had a hard time figuring out my identity as a professional in the IT space. I feel I haven't gained enough experience in the site reliability space to quickly land a job. The biggest hole in my skill set is active development skills. Coding in various languages doesn't come easy for me because I just haven't been tasked with writing code in my 4 years. I feel I have sat on this for too long, and I am at the point where it's not a plus but a must-know. I am actively planning on closing this gap, but it is a huge mountain to climb. 

### Hopeful

I am hopeful that something will work out soon; I just need to work on the gaps in my knowledge and keep the faith. This is very hard to do for me because I tend to be pessimistic when things don't go to plan.
