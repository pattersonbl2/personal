## Summary 

### Dev Tooling 
Hugo 
- **Reasoning**
I am still in the learning phase of being a software engineer. I wanted something simple and easy—a way to create a webpage for myself.

### Deployment 
- **cloudflare pages** 
I have connected Cloudflare Pages to this repository to automatically deploy to staging for any new branch commits and to production when committed to the main branch.

### Future Plans 
Connecting this webpage to the backend to enable more dynamic content.
